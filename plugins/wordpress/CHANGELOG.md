# WordPress Plugin Changelog

## [1.0.5] - 2024-09-25

### Fixed - DUPLICATE METHOD ERROR RESOLVED
- **FATAL ERROR FIX**: Removed duplicate `delete_content()` method in class-api-client.php
- **ERROR**: "Cannot redeclare WP_Headless_CMS_Bridge_API_Client::delete_content()" on line 420
- **SOLUTION**: Removed duplicate method definition while keeping original at line 114
- **RESULT**: Plugin should now activate successfully without fatal errors

### Technical Details
- Identified duplicate `public function delete_content()` methods at lines 114 and 420
- Removed the duplicate method at line 420 
- Verified all other methods are unique (create_content, update_content, etc.)
- Plugin activation should now work correctly


## [1.0.4] - 2024-09-24

### Fixed - ROOT CAUSE SOLUTION
- **IDENTIFIED ROOT CAUSE**: Changed plugin initialization timing broke WordPress activation process
- **FIXED**: Reverted to original immediate execution pattern (like v1.0.0) but with safety checks
- **SOLUTION**: Plugin now initializes immediately on file load (not deferred to plugins_loaded)
- **RESULT**: Activation hooks can now properly access plugin classes during activation

### Technical Details
- Restored immediate execution: `run_wp_headless_cms_bridge()` called directly (not via hook)
- Restored original activation/deactivation pattern with safety improvements
- Removed deferred initialization system that was causing timing conflicts
- Maintained error handling and safety checks from previous versions

### Why This Fixes The Problem
- WordPress expects plugin classes to be available during activation
- Moving initialization to `plugins_loaded` hook created timing mismatch
- Original immediate execution pattern works because classes load before activation hooks run


## [1.0.3] - 2024-09-24

### Fixed
- Enhanced plugin activation safety with comprehensive error handling
- Fixed WordPress fatal error during activation and deletion by implementing try/catch blocks
- Added defensive programming to prevent site crashes during plugin loading
- Improved plugin initialization with proper error logging

### Added
- Comprehensive error logging throughout plugin lifecycle
- Safe class loading with file existence checks
- ParseError and Exception handling during initialization

### Changed
- Plugin activation is now completely safe with minimal operations
- All complex initialization moved to plugins_loaded hook with error handling
- Better error messages for debugging plugin issues


## [1.0.2] - 2024-09-24

### Fixed
- Fixed fatal error during plugin activation caused by premature database operations
- Implemented deferred initialization to avoid WordPress core dependency issues
- Moved complex activation tasks (database creation, cron scheduling) to init hook
- Added safer activation process with basic option setting only

### Added
- Deferred initialization system for safer plugin activation
- Better error logging during activation and initialization process

### Changed
- Plugin activation now defers complex operations until WordPress is fully loaded
