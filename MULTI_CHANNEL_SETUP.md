# Multi-Channel Publishing Setup Guide

This guide explains how to install and configure the complete end-to-end post distribution system that publishes content from the frontend to both the Haidrun website (WordPress) and LinkedIn company page.

## Production Architecture

- **Frontend**: Deployed on Vercel (React application)
- **Backend API**: Deployed on Vercel (Node.js/Express)
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **WordPress**: Haidrun.com (with wp-headless-cms-bridge plugin)
- **LinkedIn**: Company page via LinkedIn API

---

# Part 1: Feature Branch Installation

## Step 1: Pull the Feature Branch from GitHub

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd /path/to/cms_automation

# Fetch all branches from remote
git fetch origin

# Switch to the feature branch
git checkout feature/multi-channel-publishing-complete

# Pull latest changes
git pull origin feature/multi-channel-publishing-complete
```

## Step 2: Deploy Feature Branch to Vercel

**IMPORTANT**: Since your frontend and backend are already configured in Vercel and connected to the GitHub repository, you need to ensure the **feature branch** is deployed, not the main branch.

### Option A: Change Production Branch (Recommended for Testing)

This temporarily changes which branch Vercel deploys to production.

#### Backend:
1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select your **backend API project** (e.g., "cms-automation-api")
3. Go to **Settings** → **Git**
4. Under **"Production Branch"**, change from `main` to `feature/multi-channel-publishing-complete`
5. Click **"Save"**
6. Go to **Deployments** tab
7. Vercel will automatically trigger a new deployment from the feature branch
8. Wait for deployment to complete (green checkmark)
9. Your backend will now serve the feature branch code

#### Frontend:
1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select your **frontend project** (e.g., "cms-automation-frontend")
3. Go to **Settings** → **Git**
4. Under **"Production Branch"**, change from `main` to `feature/multi-channel-publishing-complete`
5. Click **"Save"**
6. Go to **Deployments** tab
7. Vercel will automatically trigger a new deployment from the feature branch
8. Wait for deployment to complete
9. Your frontend will now serve the feature branch code

### Option B: Use Preview Deployments (For Testing Without Changing Production)

Vercel automatically creates preview deployments for every branch.

#### Backend:
1. Push your feature branch to GitHub: `git push origin feature/multi-channel-publishing-complete`
2. Vercel automatically creates a preview deployment
3. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard → Select backend project → **Deployments**
4. Find the deployment for `feature/multi-channel-publishing-complete` branch
5. Click on it and copy the preview URL (e.g., `https://cms-automation-api-git-feature-multi-channel-xyz.vercel.app`)
6. This URL serves your feature branch code

#### Frontend:
1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard → Select frontend project → **Deployments**
2. Find the deployment for `feature/multi-channel-publishing-complete` branch
3. Copy the preview URL (e.g., `https://cms-automation-frontend-git-feature-multi-channel-xyz.vercel.app`)

**Important**: If using preview URLs, update your frontend environment variable `VITE_API_URL` to point to the backend preview URL.

### Option C: Manual Redeploy from Vercel Dashboard

Force a redeploy from the feature branch:

#### Backend:
1. Ensure feature branch is pushed: `git push origin feature/multi-channel-publishing-complete`
2. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard → Select backend project
3. Go to **Deployments** tab
4. Find the latest deployment for the feature branch
5. Click **"⋯" (three dots)** → **"Redeploy"**
6. Select **"Use existing Build Cache"** or not (your choice)
7. Click **"Redeploy"**

#### Frontend:
Same process for frontend project

### Option D: Deploy via Vercel CLI (If Projects Don't Exist Yet)

Only use this if you haven't already set up Vercel projects.

```bash
# Navigate to backend API directory
cd backend/api

# Login to Vercel (if not already logged in)
vercel login

# Link to existing project or create new one
vercel link

# Deploy to production
vercel --prod

# Navigate to frontend directory
cd ../../frontend

# Link to existing project or create new one
vercel link

# Deploy to production
vercel --prod
```

### Verification

After deployment, verify the feature branch is deployed:

1. **Check Backend:**
   ```bash
   curl https://cms-automation-api.vercel.app/health
   ```

2. **Check Frontend:**
   Open `https://cms-automation-frontend.vercel.app` in browser

3. **Verify Git Commit:**
   - In Vercel dashboard → Deployments → Click latest deployment
   - Check the "Git Commit" shows the feature branch commit hash
   - Should match: `git log feature/multi-channel-publishing-complete -1 --format="%H"`

### After Testing: Merge to Main (Optional)

Once you've verified the feature branch works correctly:

```bash
# Switch to main branch
git checkout main

# Merge feature branch
git merge feature/multi-channel-publishing-complete

# Push to remote
git push origin main

# Change Vercel production branch back to main (if you changed it)
# Go to Vercel Settings → Git → Production Branch → Change to "main"
```

---

# Part 2: Environment Variables Configuration

**👤 Who performs these steps:** A team member with **Owner** or **Member** access to the Vercel team/project. You need permissions to modify project settings and environment variables.

## Backend Environment Variables (Vercel)

Go to your backend Vercel project → **Settings** → **Environment Variables** and add:

### Supabase Configuration
```
SUPABASE_URL=https://neezcjbguizmkbyglroe.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key
```

**How to get these:**
1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to **Settings** → **API**
4. Copy **Project URL** → use as `SUPABASE_URL`
5. Copy **service_role key** (under "Project API keys") → use as `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`

### LinkedIn API Configuration
```
LINKEDIN_CLIENT_ID=your_linkedin_app_client_id
LINKEDIN_CLIENT_SECRET=your_linkedin_app_client_secret
```

**How to get these:** See "Part 3: LinkedIn API Setup" below

### WordPress Webhook Configuration

#### Haidrun WordPress Site
```
HAIDRUN_WORDPRESS_WEBHOOK_URL=https://haidrun.com/wp-json/wp-headless-cms-bridge/v1/webhook/content
HAIDRUN_WORDPRESS_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_secure_webhook_secret
```

**How to configure:** See "Part 4: WordPress Plugin Setup" below

#### Personal WordPress Site (Optional)
```
PERSONAL_WORDPRESS_WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-personal-site.com/wp-json/wp-headless-cms-bridge/v1/webhook/content
PERSONAL_WORDPRESS_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_personal_webhook_secret
```

### After Adding Environment Variables

1. Click **"Save"** for each variable
2. Go to **Deployments** tab
3. Click **"Redeploy"** to apply the new environment variables

## Frontend Environment Variables (Vercel)

Go to your frontend Vercel project → **Settings** → **Environment Variables** and add:

```
VITE_API_URL=https://cms-automation-api.vercel.app
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://neezcjbguizmkbyglroe.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

**How to get these:**
- `VITE_API_URL`: Your backend Vercel deployment URL from Step 2
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`: Same as backend Supabase URL
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: From Supabase → Settings → API → **anon/public key**

After adding, redeploy the frontend.

# Part 3: LinkedIn API Setup

**👤 Who performs these steps:** A LinkedIn user who is an **administrator of the Haidrun LinkedIn company page**. You must have admin/owner access to the company page to link it to the app.

## Step 1: Create LinkedIn App

1. Go to https://www.linkedin.com/developers/apps
2. **Log in** with your LinkedIn account (must be admin of Haidrun company page)
3. Click **"Create app"**
4. Fill in app details:
   - **App name**: "Haidrun CMS Publishing"
   - **LinkedIn Page**: Select your Haidrun company page (you must be admin)
   - **App logo**: Upload Haidrun logo
   - **Legal agreement**: Check the box
5. Click **"Create app"**

## Step 2: Get Client ID and Client Secret

1. After creating the app, you'll be automatically redirected to the app dashboard
2. Click on the **"Auth"** tab in the left sidebar (also called "Authentication")
3. Under **"Authentication Keys"** section, you'll see:
   - **Client ID** (also called API Key or Consumer Key)
   - **Primary Client Secret** (click "Show" to reveal it)
4. **Copy both values** - you'll need them for Vercel
5. Add these to your Vercel backend environment variables:
   ```
   LINKEDIN_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
   LINKEDIN_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
   ```

**⚠️ Security:** Keep your Client Secret confidential. Never expose it in client-side code or public repositories.

## Step 3: Request API Access

**CRITICAL FOR COMPANY PAGE POSTING:** You must get approval for the **Marketing Developer Platform** product to obtain the `w_organization_social` scope required for posting to company pages.

### Step 3A: Request Sign In with LinkedIn (Immediate - Usually Auto-Approved)

1. Go to **Products** tab in your app dashboard
2. Find **"Sign In with LinkedIn using OpenID Connect"** or **"Sign In with LinkedIn"**
3. Click **"Request access"**
4. Usually approved instantly
5. This gives you basic scopes: `openid`, `profile`, `email`

### Step 3B: Request Marketing Developer Platform (Required - Manual Review)

**This is REQUIRED for company page posting.**

1. Go to **Products** tab in your app dashboard
2. Find **"Marketing Developer Platform"**
   - If you don't see it, it may be listed as "Share on LinkedIn" or similar
3. Click **"Request access"** or **"Apply"**
4. You'll need to fill out an application form:
   - **Use case**: "Content Management System for posting to company LinkedIn page"
   - **Description**: "We're building a CMS to automatically publish blog content from our website to our LinkedIn company page. I am an administrator of the company page."
   - **Company**: Select your Haidrun company page
   - **Intended use**: "Automated content publishing to company page"
5. Submit the application
6. **Wait for approval** (can take 1-2 days to several weeks)

**What you get after approval:**
- ✅ `w_organization_social` - Post to company/organization pages
- ✅ `r_organization_social` - Read organization content

### Step 3C: Alternative - w_member_social (For Personal Profile Only)

If you can't wait for Marketing Developer Platform approval, you can test with personal profile posting:

1. The default scopes (`openid`, `profile`, `w_member_social`, `email`) allow posting to your **personal** LinkedIn profile
2. Posts will appear on your personal profile, NOT the company page
3. This is useful for testing the OAuth flow and system integration
4. Once approved for Marketing Developer Platform, switch to company page posting

**Available Products by Scope:**

| Product | Scopes | Approval Time | Company Posting |
|---------|--------|---------------|-----------------|
| Sign In with LinkedIn | `openid`, `profile`, `email` | Instant | ❌ No |
| Share on LinkedIn | `w_member_social` | Instant | ❌ No (personal only) |
| Marketing Developer Platform | `w_organization_social`, `r_organization_social` | 1-2 days to weeks | ✅ Yes |

**If you don't see these products:**
- Ensure your LinkedIn account is an admin of the Haidrun company page
- Some products require LinkedIn verification of your company
- Contact LinkedIn Developer Support at https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/ask/TSO-IDK if products are missing

## Step 4: Configure OAuth Redirect URLs

1. Go to **Auth** tab
2. Under **Redirect URLs**, add:
   ```
   https://cms-automation-api.vercel.app/api/v1/linkedin/callback
   https://localhost:5000/api/v1/linkedin/callback (for testing)
   ```
3. Click **"Update"**

**Important:** The redirect URI must match EXACTLY what your backend uses. The correct path is `/api/v1/linkedin/callback`.

## Step 5: Generate Access Token (Fully Automated)

You need to get an access token for your Haidrun company page with the correct OAuth scopes.

**Required OAuth Scopes for Company Page Posting:**
- `w_organization_social` - **REQUIRED** for posting to company/organization pages
- `r_liteprofile` - For basic profile information
- `r_organization_social` - For reading organization content (optional)

**Note:**
- `w_member_social` is for personal profiles only, not company pages. Using the wrong scope will result in a 403 Forbidden error when trying to post.
- LinkedIn's manual token generator does NOT provide `w_organization_social` scope. You must use the full OAuth flow.

### Fully Automated OAuth Flow

The backend has been configured with a complete OAuth flow that requires NO manual steps. Everything happens automatically.

**Prerequisites:**
- Your backend is deployed to Vercel with LinkedIn credentials configured
- The CMS backend includes these endpoints:
  - `GET /api/v1/linkedin/auth-url` - Generates OAuth URL
  - `GET /api/v1/linkedin/callback` - Handles LinkedIn redirect automatically
  - `POST /api/v1/linkedin/connect` - Alternative manual connection method

#### Step-by-Step OAuth Process:

**Step 1: Get the LinkedIn Authorization URL**

Make a GET request to generate the OAuth URL:

```bash
curl "https://cms-automation-api.vercel.app/api/v1/linkedin/auth-url?redirectUri=https://cms-automation-api.vercel.app/api/v1/linkedin/callback"
```

Response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "authUrl": "https://www.linkedin.com/oauth/v2/authorization?response_type=code&client_id=..."
  }
}
```

**Step 2: Authorize with LinkedIn**

1. Copy the `authUrl` from the response
2. **Open it in your browser** (must be done by someone who is admin of Haidrun company page)
3. **Log in with the LinkedIn account** that is an admin of Haidrun company page
4. LinkedIn will display permission request for your app
5. Review the requested permissions (should include `w_organization_social`)
6. Click **"Allow"** to authorize

**Step 3: Automatic Callback Processing**

After clicking "Allow", LinkedIn redirects to:
```
https://cms-automation-api.vercel.app/api/v1/linkedin/callback?code=AQT...&state=...
```

The backend automatically:
1. ✅ Receives the authorization code
2. ✅ Exchanges code for access token
3. ✅ Retrieves your LinkedIn profile
4. ✅ Gets all organizations you admin (including Haidrun)
5. ✅ Stores credentials in Supabase `social_accounts` table
6. ✅ Displays success page with your profile and organization list

**Step 4: View Success Confirmation**

You'll see an HTML success page showing:
- ✅ "LinkedIn Authorization Successful!"
- Your profile name and ID
- List of organizations you have admin access to (including Haidrun)
- Confirmation that credentials are stored

**That's it!** No manual code copying, no curl commands, no additional steps. The entire OAuth flow is fully automated.

**Alternative: Use the Frontend**

If your frontend has LinkedIn OAuth integration:
1. Go to your frontend settings page
2. Click "Connect LinkedIn Account"
3. Follow the authorization flow
4. Token will be stored automatically

**Troubleshooting OAuth Flow:**

- **Error: "LINKEDIN_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE"** → Check that `LINKEDIN_CLIENT_ID` and `LINKEDIN_CLIENT_SECRET` are set in Vercel backend environment variables
- **Error: "Invalid redirect URI"** → Ensure the redirect URI `https://cms-automation-api.vercel.app/api/v1/linkedin/callback` matches exactly what you configured in LinkedIn app Auth settings (Step 4 above)
- **Error: "Insufficient permissions"** → Ensure you authorized with an account that is admin of Haidrun company page
- **Token doesn't work for company posting** → Verify the `w_organization_social` scope was included and approved
- **Database error** → Check Supabase connection and verify `social_accounts` table exists

## Step 6: Get Company Organization ID

You need to find the numerical ID for your Haidrun company page and convert it to an organization URN.

### Method 1: From Company Page URL (Easiest)

1. Go to https://www.linkedin.com/company/haidrun/ (or your company page)
2. Look at the URL in your browser's address bar
3. The company ID is the number after `/company/`
   - Example: `https://www.linkedin.com/company/12345678/` → Company ID is `12345678`
4. Create the URN: `urn:li:organization:12345678`

**Note:** If your URL uses a vanity name (like `/company/haidrun/` instead of a number), use Method 2 or 3.

### Method 2: Using Browser Developer Tools

1. Go to your Haidrun LinkedIn company page
2. Open browser Developer Tools (F12 or right-click → Inspect)
3. Go to **Network** tab
4. Click the **Follow** or **Unfollow** button on the company page
5. Look for a POST request to a URL containing `fsd_company:`
   - Example: `...urn:li:fsd_company:12345678`
6. The number after `fsd_company:` is your company ID
7. Create the URN: `urn:li:organization:12345678`

### Method 3: Using LinkedIn API (If You Have Access Token)

1. Use the organizationalEntityAcls endpoint to get organizations you admin:
   ```bash
   curl -X GET 'https://api.linkedin.com/v2/organizationalEntityAcls?q=roleAssignee' \
     -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN'
   ```
2. Look for your Haidrun company in the response
3. Extract the organization URN (e.g., `urn:li:organization:12345678`)

### Result Format

Your final organization URN should look like:
```
urn:li:organization:12345678
```

This URN will be used when inserting the LinkedIn account into the Supabase database (Step 2 of Part 5).

# Part 5: Supabase Database Configuration

**👤 Who performs these steps:** A team member with **Owner** or **Admin** access to the Supabase project. You need permissions to run SQL queries and modify the database.

## Step 1: Create Database Tables

You need to create the required tables for the multi-channel publishing system.

### Option A: Run Complete Schema File (Recommended)

1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to **SQL Editor**
4. Click **"New Query"**
5. Copy the entire contents of `/scripts/schema.sql` from your project
6. Paste into the SQL editor
7. Click **"Run"** (or press Ctrl+Enter)
8. Wait for confirmation that all statements executed successfully

### Option B: Run Schema Manually (Step by Step)

If you prefer to create tables individually or the full schema fails, follow these steps:

#### 1. Enable UUID Extension

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp";
```

#### 2. Create Core Content Tables

```sql
-- Content Types
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.content_types (
    id VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    schema JSONB NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}',
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Content Items (stores blog posts and content)
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.content_items (
    id VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,
    content_type_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL REFERENCES content_types(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    title VARCHAR(500) NOT NULL,
    content JSONB NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}',
    status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'draft' CHECK (status IN ('draft', 'published', 'archived')),
    published_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    created_by UUID,
    updated_by UUID
);
```

#### 3. Create Social Media Tables (Required for Multi-Channel)

```sql
-- Social Accounts (stores LinkedIn/social media credentials)
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.social_accounts (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    platform VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL CHECK (platform IN ('linkedin', 'facebook', 'twitter', 'instagram')),
    account_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    account_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    access_token TEXT NOT NULL,
    refresh_token TEXT,
    expires_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
    account_data JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    UNIQUE(platform, account_id)
);

-- Social Posts (tracks scheduled and published posts)
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.social_posts (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    content_id VARCHAR(255),
    platform VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL CHECK (platform IN ('linkedin', 'facebook', 'twitter', 'instagram')),
    account_id UUID REFERENCES social_accounts(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'scheduled' CHECK (status IN ('scheduled', 'published', 'failed', 'cancelled')),
    scheduled_time TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    published_time TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    post_data JSONB NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}',
    platform_post_id VARCHAR(255),
    retry_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    max_retries INTEGER DEFAULT 3,
    error_message TEXT,
    analytics_data JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

#### 4. Create Indexes for Performance

```sql
-- Content indexes
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_content_items_status ON content_items(status);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_content_items_published_at ON content_items(published_at);

-- Social media indexes
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_social_accounts_platform ON social_accounts(platform);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_social_accounts_active ON social_accounts(is_active);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_social_posts_platform ON social_posts(platform);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_social_posts_status ON social_posts(status);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_social_posts_scheduled_time ON social_posts(scheduled_time);
```

#### 5. Enable Row Level Security

```sql
-- Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE public.content_types ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.content_items ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.social_accounts ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.social_posts ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create permissive policies (adjust as needed for your security requirements)
CREATE POLICY "Allow full access to content_types" ON public.content_types FOR ALL USING (true);
CREATE POLICY "Allow full access to content_items" ON public.content_items FOR ALL USING (true);
CREATE POLICY "Allow full access to social_accounts" ON public.social_accounts FOR ALL USING (true);
CREATE POLICY "Allow full access to social_posts" ON public.social_posts FOR ALL USING (true);
```

### Verify Tables Were Created

After running the schema, verify the tables exist:

1. In Supabase dashboard, go to **Table Editor**
2. You should see these tables:
   - ✅ `content_types`
   - ✅ `content_items` - Stores blog posts and content
   - ✅ `social_accounts` - Stores LinkedIn/social media credentials
   - ✅ `social_posts` - Tracks scheduled and published social posts
   - ✅ `content_social_mappings` (if using full schema)
   - ✅ `media_files` (if using full schema)

## Step 2: Verify LinkedIn Account is Stored

After completing the OAuth flow in Part 3, Step 5, the LinkedIn account is automatically stored in the `social_accounts` table.

Verify the account was stored correctly:

```sql
SELECT
  id,
  platform,
  account_name,
  account_id,
  is_active,
  account_data,
  created_at
FROM social_accounts
WHERE platform = 'linkedin'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

You should see:
- `platform`: `linkedin`
- `account_name`: Your LinkedIn profile name (e.g., "John Doe")
- `account_id`: Your LinkedIn member ID
- `is_active`: `true`
- `account_data`: JSON object containing organizations you admin (including Haidrun)

**If the OAuth flow completed successfully, you don't need to manually insert anything.** The backend's `/callback` route handles all database operations automatically.

**Optional: Manual Insert (Only if OAuth Flow Failed)**

If the OAuth flow failed and you need to manually insert the LinkedIn account, you can use:

```sql
INSERT INTO social_accounts (
  platform,
  account_name,
  account_id,
  access_token,
  is_active,
  account_data
) VALUES (
  'linkedin',
  'Your Name',
  'your_linkedin_member_id',
  'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN',
  true,
  '{"organizations": [{"organizationId": "urn:li:organization:YOUR_ORG_ID", "role": "ADMINISTRATOR"}]}'
);
```

Replace:
- `Your Name` - Your LinkedIn profile name
- `your_linkedin_member_id` - Your LinkedIn member identifier
- `YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN` - The access token from Part 3
- `YOUR_ORG_ID` - The Haidrun organization ID (numerical part only)

---

# Part 6: Testing and Verification

## Step 1: Test Backend API

Test that your backend is responding:

```bash
# Replace with your actual backend URL
curl https://cms-automation-api.vercel.app/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-XX..."
}
```

## Step 2: Test Content Publishing Endpoints

```bash
# Check content publishing service status
curl https://cms-automation-api.vercel.app/api/v1/content-publishing/status

# Check pending social posts
curl https://cms-automation-api.vercel.app/api/v1/content-publishing/pending

# Check orchestrator statistics
curl https://cms-automation-api.vercel.app/api/v1/content-publishing/orchestrator/stats
```

## Step 3: Manual End-to-End Test

1. Open your frontend URL (e.g., `https://cms-automation-frontend.vercel.app`)
2. Click **"Create Content"**
3. Fill in:
   - **Title**: "Test Multi-Channel Publishing"
   - **Content**: "This is a test post to verify the multi-channel publishing system."
   - **Status**: Published
   - **Company Brand**: Haidrun
   - ✓ Check **"Haidrun Website (WordPress)"**
   - ✓ Check **"LinkedIn Company Page"**
4. Click **"Create Content"**
5. Wait for success message

## Step 4: Verify WordPress Publication

1. Go to https://haidrun.com/blog (or your blog URL)
2. Look for your test post
3. It should appear immediately with correct title and content

## Step 5: Verify LinkedIn Scheduling

1. Check Supabase `social_posts` table:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM social_posts
   WHERE platform = 'linkedin'
   ORDER BY created_at DESC
   LIMIT 1;
   ```
2. Verify the post is scheduled for 12PM UTC on next business day
3. Wait until scheduled time and check Haidrun LinkedIn company page

# Part 7: Complete Workflow Overview

## How It Works in Production

### 1. User Creates Content
- User opens frontend at `https://cms-automation-frontend.vercel.app`
- Fills out content form with title, content, and publishing options
- Selects "Haidrun" as company branding
- Checks both "Publish to WordPress" and "Publish to LinkedIn"
- Clicks submit

### 2. Backend Processing (Vercel)
- Frontend sends request to backend API at `https://cms-automation-api.vercel.app`
- Backend creates content in Supabase database with status "published"
- Backend sends webhook to WordPress at `https://haidrun.com`
- Backend creates scheduled LinkedIn post in database
- Returns success/failure status for each channel

### 3. WordPress Publishing (Immediate)
- WordPress plugin at haidrun.com receives webhook
- Authenticates webhook using HMAC SHA256 signature
- Creates new post on Haidrun website
- Post appears immediately on https://haidrun.com

### 4. LinkedIn Publishing (Scheduled)
- Social Media Orchestrator runs periodically on Vercel
- Finds scheduled posts for current time
- Formats content with Haidrun branding and hashtags
- Posts to Haidrun LinkedIn company page via API
- Marks post as published in database

---

# Part 8: Automated Testing

You can run automated tests to verify the entire flow.

## Update Test Script URLs

Edit `test-multi-channel-publishing.js` and update:

```javascript
const API_BASE_URL = 'https://cms-automation-api.vercel.app';
```

## Run Tests

```bash
node test-multi-channel-publishing.js
```

This will test:
- Backend API connectivity
- Content creation with multi-channel publishing
- WordPress webhook delivery
- LinkedIn post scheduling
- Status monitoring

**Solutions:**
1. Check Vercel deployment status at https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Verify backend deployment is successful (green checkmark)
3. Test backend URL directly: `curl https://cms-automation-api.vercel.app/health`
4. Check Vercel logs for errors
5. Verify environment variables are set correctly
6. Redeploy if necessary

### Issue: WordPress Webhook Fails

**Symptoms:**
- Content created in database but not on WordPress
- Webhook authentication errors in logs

**Solutions:**
1. Verify webhook URL is correct in Vercel environment variables
2. Check webhook secret matches between WordPress and Vercel
3. Ensure WordPress plugin is active: https://haidrun.com/wp-admin/plugins.php
4. Test webhook endpoint: `curl https://haidrun.com/wp-json/wp-headless-cms-bridge/v1/webhook/health`
5. Check WordPress plugin version (should be 1.0.6+)
6. Review WordPress error logs
7. Verify haidrun.com server firewall allows incoming webhooks

### Issue: LinkedIn Publishing Fails

**Symptoms:**
- LinkedIn posts not scheduled
- LinkedIn API errors in logs

**Solutions:**
1. Verify LinkedIn API credentials in Vercel environment variables
2. Check `social_accounts` table in Supabase has Haidrun LinkedIn account
3. Verify LinkedIn access token is not expired
4. Ensure organization URN is correct format: `urn:li:organization:XXXXX`
5. Check LinkedIn app has required permissions:
   - Share on LinkedIn
   - Marketing Developer Platform (for company pages)
6. Review LinkedIn API rate limits
7. Test LinkedIn API manually with curl

### Issue: Content Not Created in Database

**Symptoms:**
- Form submission fails
- "Database error" messages

**Solutions:**
1. Check Supabase connection in Vercel environment variables
2. Verify `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` are correct
3. Check Supabase project status at https://supabase.com/dashboard
4. Verify database schema exists (run schema.sql if needed)
5. Check table permissions in Supabase
6. Review backend Vercel logs for specific error messages

### Issue: Frontend Can't Connect to Backend

**Symptoms:**
- CORS errors in browser console
- API requests fail

**Solutions:**
1. Verify `VITE_API_URL` in frontend Vercel environment variables
2. Check backend CORS configuration allows frontend domain
3. Ensure both frontend and backend are using HTTPS
4. Test backend directly: `curl https://cms-automation-api.vercel.app/health`
5. Clear browser cache and reload
6. Redeploy frontend after fixing environment variables

## Debug Endpoints

Use these endpoints to diagnose issues:

### Check Service Status
```bash
curl https://cms-automation-api.vercel.app/api/v1/content-publishing/status
```

### Check Pending LinkedIn Posts
```bash
curl https://cms-automation-api.vercel.app/api/v1/content-publishing/pending
```

### Check Orchestrator Statistics
```bash
curl https://cms-automation-api.vercel.app/api/v1/content-publishing/orchestrator/stats
```

### Manual WordPress Trigger (if webhook failed)
```bash
curl -X POST https://cms-automation-api.vercel.app/api/v1/content-publishing/trigger/{contentId}
```

### Manual LinkedIn Processing (process pending posts immediately)
```bash
curl -X POST https://cms-automation-api.vercel.app/api/v1/content-publishing/orchestrator/process
```

# Part 11: Security Best Practices

## Environment Variables Security

1. ✅ **Never commit credentials to Git**
   - All secrets stored in Vercel environment variables
   - Use `.env.example` for documentation only

2. ✅ **Use strong webhook secrets**
   - Minimum 32 characters
   - Random alphanumeric characters
   - Rotate periodically

3. ✅ **Protect Supabase service key**
   - Never expose in frontend
   - Only use in backend API
   - Keep separate from anon key

4. ✅ **Secure LinkedIn credentials**
   - Store only in backend environment variables
   - Use OAuth tokens with expiration
   - Implement token refresh logic

## WordPress Security

1. Keep plugin updated to latest version
2. Use HTTPS for all webhook communications
3. Validate webhook signatures (HMAC SHA256)
4. Limit webhook endpoint access if possible

## API Security

1. Implement rate limiting on backend endpoints
2. Validate all incoming data
3. Use HTTPS for all communications
4. Monitor for suspicious activity in Vercel logs

# Part 12: Maintenance and Updates

## Regular Maintenance Tasks

### Weekly
- Check LinkedIn token expiration
- Review Vercel logs for errors
- Monitor WordPress plugin status

### Monthly
- Review Supabase storage usage
- Clean up old social_posts records
- Update dependencies in package.json
- Check LinkedIn API usage/limits

### As Needed
- Rotate webhook secrets

- Update environment variables

## Updating the Feature Branch

When updates are made to the feature branch:

### If Using Auto-Deploy (Recommended)

If your Vercel projects are connected to GitHub:

1. Push changes to the feature branch:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/multi-channel-publishing-complete
   ```

2. Vercel will automatically deploy:
   - If production branch is set to `feature/multi-channel-publishing-complete`, it deploys to production
   - Otherwise, creates a preview deployment

3. Check deployments in Vercel dashboard to verify

### If Using Manual Deploy

```bash
# Pull latest changes
git pull origin feature/multi-channel-publishing-complete

# Deploy backend
cd backend/api
vercel --prod

# Deploy frontend
cd ../../frontend
vercel --prod
```

### When Ready to Go Live

Once the feature branch is tested and ready:

1. **Merge to main:**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge feature/multi-channel-publishing-complete
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Update Vercel production branch:**
   - Go to both projects in Vercel dashboard
   - Settings → Git → Production Branch → Change back to `main`
   - Vercel will auto-deploy from main

3. **Clean up:**
   ```bash
   # Delete feature branch locally (optional)
   git branch -d feature/multi-channel-publishing-complete

   # Delete remote feature branch (optional)
   git push origin --delete feature/multi-channel-publishing-complete
   ```
